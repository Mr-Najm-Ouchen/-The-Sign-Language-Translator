The Sign Language Translator is an advanced tool designed to bridge communication gaps by converting sign language gestures into text or spoken words. It uses computer vision, deep learning models, and real-time processing to recognize hand movements and gestures that represent specific signs from languages like American Sign Language (ASL) or other regional sign languages. The system typically operates through a webcam or a deviceâ€™s camera, where it captures live hand gestures, processes them using a trained model, and translates them into readable or audible text.

Key features include:

Real-time Translation: Converts sign language gestures into text or speech instantly.
Multi-Language Support: Can support different sign languages, such as ASL, BSL (British Sign Language), or Arabic Sign Language.
Accessibility: Provides an intuitive interface that enhances accessibility for people with hearing or speech disabilities.
AI-Powered Recognition: Uses machine learning models like TensorFlow or Keras to recognize and interpret hand gestures and translate them accurately.
Text-to-Speech: Converts the recognized text into speech for those who cannot read it.
